% Solution for "forthcomming" articles
% https://jblevins.org/log/forthcoming
% Can then use somethign like the following in 
% the "year" option of article class:
% "\noop{3001}in press"

% https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/31384/how-to-enter-publications-in-press-or-submitted-to-in-bibtex
% Observe that I recommend using fake years -- such as 3001, 3002, and so on -- to make clear to all readers of the .bib file (including yourself!) that these aren't real publication dates but are being used solely for the purpose of ensuring a correct sorting order.
